Recommendations
Actionable steps NovaRetail can take based on the findings:
* Replicate the September playbook: Perform a retroactive campaign analysis for September
(promotions, stock levels, channel mix) and replicate successful tactics.

* Invest in Lagos & Abuja market penetration: Lagos drives ~31.5% of revenue — prioritize
marketing and inventory for Lagos. Abuja shows strong accessories volume — push targeted
accessories promotions there.

* Focus on retention programs: Returning customers deliver ~59% of revenue — build loyalty
programs, repeat-purchase incentives, and targeted offers to increase lifetime value.

* Leverage top sales reps: Study Abdul Salim’s approach (accounts, leads, pricing, negotiation)
and replicate best practices (mentorship, commission structure). Consider targeted incentives to
lift mid-tier reps.

* Optimize discount strategy: Average discount per transaction (₦3,248) and total discount
(₦357,300) are reasonable — monitor margin impact during promo months; use targeted
coupons rather than blanket discounts.

* Prioritize high-margin inventory: Since electronics yield high revenue per unit, ensure
consistent stock, warranty/upsell bundles, and premium service offerings.

* Encourage repeat purchases among one-time buyers: Convert single-purchase customers
(~70% of customers) with follow-up offers, cross-sell emails, and small loyalty rewards.

* Investigate Port Harcourt impact: Since excluding Port Harcourt changes total revenue
materially, review operations/returns/late deliveries in that city and optimize logistics or
marketing spend accordingly.
